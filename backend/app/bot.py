"""
Telegram bot logic (aiogram). This module is now imported and run as a
background task INSIDE the FastAPI process (see main.py's lifespan) instead
of needing its own separate Railway service — this keeps you on a single
service, which is cheaper than running two.

If you ever outgrow this (very high traffic, want the bot to restart
independently of the API) you can still run this file standalone with:
    python -m app.bot
That fallback is kept at the bottom of this file.
