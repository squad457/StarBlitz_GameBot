"""
In-app games: Spin Wheel and Scratch Card.

Design (per product requirement):
- Spin Wheel: the admin sets a payout range (spin_min_reward, spin_max_reward —
  e.g. 0.09-0.5 Birr). The wheel can only ever LAND on a segment whose number
  falls inside that range, and the reward paid is EXACTLY that segment's
  number — so what the user sees is always what they get, and money can never
  scatter outside the admin-approved range. Segments outside the range can
  still be shown on the wheel as decorative "near miss" numbers (e.g. a big
  cosmetic jackpot number, or 0.00), but they can never actually be won.
- Scratch Card: a player always gets exactly 3 taps on the 9-cell board. The
  admin-configured number of diamonds (scratch_winning_cells) is placed at
  random positions on the board *after* the player has chosen their 3 cells,
  so the outcome is genuinely random and can't be predicted or farmed. The
  reward is tiered by how many of the 3 tapped cells turn out to hold a
  diamond (0 = no reward, 1 = small, 2 = medium, 3 = the best tier) and is
  always drawn from a slice that stays fully inside the admin's
  [scratch_min_reward, scratch_max_reward] range. The full board (all diamond
  positions, not just the tapped ones) is always returned so the frontend can
  reveal exactly where the diamonds were, whether the player won or not.
- Each user gets a small number of free plays per day (admin-configurable).
  Once those are used, playing again requires watching a rewarded Adsgram ad
  first — the frontend calls showRewardedAd() and passes the resulting
  reward_event here, which is checked for uniqueness so the same ad view can't
  unlock more than one extra play.
- An optional hard daily cap (spin_max_daily_spins / scratch_max_daily) still
  applies even to ad-unlocked plays, so the games can't be farmed indefinitely.
